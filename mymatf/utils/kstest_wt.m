function [testrst,prob,stats] = kstest_wt(x, wt, nullOBJ, alpha)
% [testrst,prob,stats] = kstest_wt(x, wt, nullOBJ, alpha)
%
% This function is essentially trying to do the same thing as
% as the built-in function 'kstest' does, which is One-sample
% Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Tests if a sample comes from a 
% continuous distribution with specified parameters, against
% the alternative that it does not come from that distribution.
%
% The difference is that, this function deals with the data that
% has unequal weights, i.e. not 1s. The implementation follows
% procedure in Numerical Recipes Ch. 14.3.3, so that it might
% not be the same as matlab. 
%
% Given an array data[0..n-1], and given a user-supplied function
% of a single variable func that is a cumulative distribution 
% function ranging from 0 (for smallest values of its argument) 
% to 1 (for largest values of its argument), this routine returns
% the KS statistic d and the p-value prob.
%
%   Small values of prob show that the cumulative distribution 
%   function of data is significantly different from func.
%
% The array data is modified by being sorted into ascending order.
%
%   OUTPUT:
%       testrst:    test decision, 1 reject, 0 failure to reject
%       prob:       p-value probability p of the hypothesis testm
%       stats:      the structure stats containing information like
%                   chi-square statistic 
%   
%   INPUT:
%       x:       binned data set 1
%       wt:       expected data set whose distribution is known
%       refobj:       bin width, for additional check for the number 
%                   of constraints
%       alpha:      significance level, to be compared with prob

% 'prob' is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the
