function [testrst,prob,stats] = kstest2_wt(x1, wt1, x2, wt2, alpha)
% [testrst,prob,stats] = kstest2_wt(x1, wt1, x2, wt2, alpha)
%
% This function is essentially trying to do the same thing as
% as the built-in function 'kstest2' does, which is Two-sample
% Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Tests if two samples come from the
% same continuous distribution, against the alternative that 
% they do not come from the same distribution.
%
% The difference is that, this function deals with the data that
% has unequal weights, i.e. not 1s. The implementation follows
% procedure in Numerical Recipes Ch. 14.3.3, so that it might
% not be the same as matlab. 
%
% Given an array data1[0..n1-1], and an array data2[0..n2-1], 
% this routine returns the K??S statistic d and the p-value 
% prob for the null hypothesis that the data sets are drawn
% from the same distribution.
%
%   Small values of prob show that the cumulative distribution
%   function of data1 is significantly different from that of data2.
%
% The arrays data1 and data2 are modified by being sorted into ascending order.
%
%   OUTPUT:
%       testrst:    test decision, 1 reject, 0 failure to reject
%       prob:       p-value probability p of the hypothesis testm
%       stats:      the structure stats containing information like
%                   chi-square statistic 
%   
%   INPUT:
%       x1:       binned data set 1
%       wt1:      expected data set whose distribution is known
%       x2:       bin width, for additional check for the number 
%                 of constraints
%       wt2:    
%       alpha:      significance level, to be compared with prob
