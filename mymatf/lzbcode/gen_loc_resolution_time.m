% function gen_loc_resolution_time
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This script is used to obtain the location resolution of the detection in
% HF and LF. In time domain, HF detection is precise to 1/4 sample in 40 sps,
% on the contrary, LF is precise to 1 sample in 20 sps. Thus the resolution in
% time is 1:8. Choose several control points, (off12, off13) = (+-1, 0) and
% (0, +-1) to obtain the resulting location could illustrate the location
% resolution.
% It seems that at least in fam 002 with PGC detector, the (-1/4,0) and (0, -1/4)
% in 40 sps are indistinguishable. But in LZB detector, it should n't have this
% issue. The reason comes from the grid size of the input slab. However, the
% slab itself is interpolated to a denser grid. Doesm't really make sense to
% use a denser interpolation.
